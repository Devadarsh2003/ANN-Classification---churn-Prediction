### ANN-Classification---churn-Prediction

##Overview
This project implements a customer churn prediction model using machine learning techniques. The application is built with Streamlit, allowing users to input customer data and receive predictions on whether a customer is likely to churn.
##Files Included
app.py: The main Streamlit application file that handles user input and displays predictions.
prediction.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the prediction logic and model evaluation.
experiments.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook for experimenting with different models and parameters.
